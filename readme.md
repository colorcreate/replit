a Replica of repl.it

# Replit

as you know, [repl.it](https://repl.it/languages/javascript) is amazing compiler online
I always use it, especialy when I wanna test my javacsript algorithm

in this project, I try to replicate this stuff but only in javascript language.
I just focus in main controller and I am really sorry about my broken css


At least there are two tools to make Repl.it to be amazing compiler online

- [ace](http://ace.c9.io/) code editor
    > replit use _ace_ as code editor, so do I. 
    > you can use _ace_ as your web page editor. Just try it, it's gonna blow up you mind

- [jqconsole](replit.github.io/jq-console/) web terminal
    > replit use _jqconsole_ as their terminal
    > it's editable, you can customize it just like what you want
    > if you need terminal in web, I recomend you _jqconsole_

you can check this project in [here](https://colorcreate.github.io/replit/)
